      <description>After the payment When your customers successfully complete payments they are redirected to the success URL page that you passed in a request parameter. Typically, this is a page on your website that informs your customer that their payment was successful.
To fulfil the customer’s purchase you can make it in several ways:
Fulfilling purchases manually with the PaySuper Dashboard
Fulfilling purchases automatically with webhooks
Email receipts
Fulfilling purchases with the PaySuper Dashboard Every customers&amp;rsquo; payment is recorded as a new entry in the payments log shown on the Transactions page.</description>

      <description>Webhooks The PaySuper system can send you notifications for a set of events during the flow, such as creating new accounts or transaction flow, making payouts, and so on.
These notifications are sent as webhooks to the corresponding URL configured on your Project Webhook page.
In most cases, webhooks are triggered by user actions on your website or back-end related events like a successful payment, refund payment and other.</description>
