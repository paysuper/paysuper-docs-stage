Interaction with the payment interface  The user begins their interaction with the payment form by clicking on an interface element on the website.

      <description>We do not identify them based solely on IP. We recognize a USA user who came to Germany and opened the payment interface there, so as not to make the mistake of showing them the form in German and with German payment methods.

      <description>When Pay One has enough data to communicate with the user and it is not prohibited by local laws, the user is prompted to finish the transaction: via email, a push-notification or instant messenger.
If integrated with Uttu, you can also set up a channel for delivering such notifications through banners or other ad placements.
 This approach allows you to return about 5% of users who have not completed the payment.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.stg.pay.super.com/about/settlement-disputes/</guid>
      <description>A return of funds can be initiated not only by you (refund), but also on the side of the payment method, for example, at the user’s request to the card-issuing bank (chargeback).
The rules for handling such situations differ depending on the payment method and territory.
 In all cases, Pay One consistently notifies you via the API and in your account.
 As a rule, you have about 30 days to dispute a chargeback on a specific transaction by providing proof that the buyer has received the product.</description>
